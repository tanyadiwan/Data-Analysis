# Heart Failure Prediction

This Kaggle project focuses on predicting heart disease, a critical healthcare application that can aid in early intervention and patient care.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Heart Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tanyadiwan/heart-disease-analysis). It contains the following features:

- `Age`: Age of the patient.
- `Sex`: Gender of the patient (0 for female, 1 for male).
- `ChestPainType`: Type of chest pain.
- `RestingBP`: Resting blood pressure.
- `Cholesterol`: Cholesterol level.
- `FastingBS`: Fasting blood sugar level.
- `RestingECG`: Resting electrocardiographic results.
- `MaxHR`: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- `ExerciseAngina`: Exercise-induced angina (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- `Oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- `ST_Slope`: Slope of the ST segment.
- `HeartDisease`: Presence of heart disease (0 for no, 1 for yes, the target variable).

## Analysis and Modeling

In this Kaggle project:

1. **Data Exploration**: We explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and potential patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning models are experimented with, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict heart disease.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results are visualized using confusion matrices.

5. **Kaggle Project Link**: You can view and interact with the Kaggle project directly [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tanyadiwan/heart-disease-analysis). Feel free to provide feedback or contribute.

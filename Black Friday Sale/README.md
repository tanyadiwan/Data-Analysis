# Black Friday Sale


This project involves the analysis and visualization of Black Friday sales data. The dataset used for this analysis is available in the `BlackFriday.csv` file, which is included in this repository.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `Product_ID`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `Gender`: Gender of the user (e.g., 'M' for Male, 'F' for Female).
- `Age`: Age group of the user (e.g., '0-17', '18-25', '26-35', '36-45', '46-50', '51-55', '55+').
- `Occupation`: Occupation code of the user.
- `City_Category`: Category of the city where the user resides (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C').
- `Stay_In_Current_City_Years`: Number of years the user has stayed in the current city.
- `Marital_Status`: Marital status of the user (0 for Single, 1 for Married).
- `Product_Category_1`, `Product_Category_2`, `Product_Category_3`: Product category codes.
- `Purchase`: Purchase amount in dollars.

## Analysis and Visualizations

In this project, we perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning**: We clean the dataset by handling missing values (if any) and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We perform EDA to gain insights into the data. Some of the key visualizations include:
   - Distribution of purchase amounts.
   - Gender distribution of shoppers.
   - Age distribution of shoppers.
   - Purchase behavior by occupation.
   - City-wise sales analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**: We create various visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate the findings from the EDA.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**: We conduct hypothesis tests to determine if there are significant differences in purchase behavior between different groups (e.g., gender, age, marital status).
